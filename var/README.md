# $RRC_DIR/var

Data such as logs, additional script configurations, etc. can be stored here.

Any kind of stored data here should be managed by scripts / functions and is
highly recommended to avoid modify content here.

The data stored here should depend on the environment in which rrc is running,
therefore the contents of this directory are ignored by git, except for this
README.md file.
